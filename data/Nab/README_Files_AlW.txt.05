Topic: Files related to the Neutralization Dilution Assay of 
       David Montefiori at Duke University (Immunology Lab)


  
The files are: 

README_Files_AlW.txt (This file)

Neutralization_Data_Model-2006FEB06.doc 
   This is an attempt at defining a 'Data Model' along with
   enough detail to understand ther relationship to the
   assay plate template and resulting calculations by
   the Excel macro. 

TZM-bl External Proficiency Testing Study Plan_100305.doc* -
   This is the Study plan sent to all investigators for doing the 
   assay proficeiency study


TZM-bl Assay SOP_July2005.doc* - This is the SOP for conducting the assay.
   Useful reading in conjunction with the macro described below.


LuminescenceMacroUserGuide.doc* - This is the guide to the Excel macro
   that is used to calculate the 50% or 80% neutralization titer from
   the dilution curve

Luc5Samples02.xls* This is the Excel macro, described in the manual


ScreenShot.doc* - This is an example of a screen shot after importing
   in a 'raw' instrument output file into the macro


m09020511;4007.xls* - This is an example instrument file that can be read
                      into the macro. Try it to see what you get.
m0902051;3997.xls*  - Same as above
m0902053;3999.xls*  - Same as above
m0902055;4001.xls*  - Same as above
m0902057;4003.xls*  - Same as above
m0902059;4005.xls*  - Same as above

NAB_Format_CHAVI_DRAFT.doc - First draft of a File Format to send to SCHARP. 
   This will probably have some modifications, particularly with respect to
   the approach taken for a tool to keep track of what is a new record and
   what is a duplicate that is intended to overwrite an existing record.
   The tool will have much more control over that (after internal Lab
   QA is completee) than if we are just depending on a raw tab-delimited
   text file from the lab, which is what the HVTN file formats have
   assumed.
